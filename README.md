## Welcome to my Github!

### About me:
I'm Dmitriy, bilingual Russian, and I am a Computer Science student from Massachusetts. My skills consist of playing the piano as well as programming in HTML, CSS, Java, and Python for now, and learning new programming languages in the future as part of my career or even my own growth. On my freetime, I enjoy walking in the nature, drawing/painting, and seeing friends. Hope you enjoy some of my works!
